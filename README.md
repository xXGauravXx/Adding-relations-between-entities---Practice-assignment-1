# ðŸŒŽ React Travel Cards Challenge

## The Scenario
You're working at a travel agency, and your manager just handed you a list of their top travel destinations. "Our website needs a modern refresh," she says. "Can you create an engaging way to display these destinations for our customers?"

## Your Task
Create a React application that displays these travel destinations.

## The Data
Use this exact destination data in your parent component:
```javascript
const destinations = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Bali",
    location: "Indonesia",
    image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1537996194471-e657df975ab4",
    description: "Tropical paradise with beautiful beaches and vibrant culture",
    price: "$1,200"
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Paris",
    location: "France",
    image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1502602898657-3e91760cbb34",
    description: "City of love, art, and exquisite cuisine",
    price: "$1,500"
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: "Santorini",
    location: "Greece",
    image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1613395877344-13d4a8e0d49e",
    description: "Stunning sunsets and white-washed architecture",
    price: "$1,800"
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    name: "Tokyo",
    location: "Japan",
    image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1540959733332-eab4deabeeaf",
    description: "Modern city with rich traditions and amazing food",
    price: "$2,000"
  }
];
```

# **How to Fork and Set Up Your Repository**

---

## **1. Fork the Repository on StackBlitz**

- You will be provided with a **StackBlitz** link for the assignment.
- Open the link in your browser and click on the **Fork** button in StackBlitz.  
  This will create a copy of the repository in your StackBlitz account.

---

## **2. Clone the Repository to Your Personal GitHub**

- After forking, you can download the project or push it directly to your personal GitHub repository:
  - **Option 1: Download and Push**
    1. Download the repository files from StackBlitz.
    2. Open your terminal/command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and run:
       ```bash
       git init
       git remote add origin <your_github_repo_url>
       ```
       Replace `<your_github_repo_url>` with your personal GitHub repository URL.
    3. Commit and push the files to your GitHub repository:
       ```bash
       git add .
       git commit -m "Completed the assignment"
       git push -u origin main
       ```
  - **Option 2: Push Directly**
    1. Use the **Push to GitHub** option in StackBlitz to directly connect and push the repository to your GitHub account.

---

## **3. Submission Instructions**

- Once your code is successfully pushed to GitHub:
  1. Copy the link to your GitHub repository.
  2. Submit the link on the assignment submission portal.  
     The link should follow this format:  
     **`https://github.com/<your_username>/<repository_name>`**

---

### **Example Submission**

If your GitHub username is `johnDoe` and the repository name is `assignment-repo`, the submission link would look like this:  
**`https://github.com/johnDoe/assignment-repo`**
